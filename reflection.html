    Reflect: 

    I could've allocated more time if I followed the tutorials first, before compeleteing the project. This will allow me to learn how to use Unity, 
    as throughout the project there were a lot of technical issues as to extent of using the software Unity. What I've learnt is that creating a game in Unity
    not only requrie you to know the lanauge C#, but also how use the Unity Editior too. As the editior can be complex and complicated and almost 40% of my time 
    was spent on exploring where everthing was on the unity editor, not in Visual Studio Code.
